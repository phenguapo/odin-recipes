      <h2>An introduction to moussaka</h2>
      <p>
        Moussaka is an eggplant- or potato-based dish, often including ground
        meat, which is common in the Balkans and the Middle East, with many
        local and regional variations. The English name for moussaka was
        borrowed from Greek mousakás (μουσακάς) and from other Balkan languages,
        all borrowed from Ottoman Turkish, which in turn borrοwed it from Arabic
        muṣaqqa‘a (مصقعة, lit. 'pounded' or 'cold'). The word is first attested
        in English in 1862, written mùzàkkà.

      <h3>Step by step explanation on how to make moussaka:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat a frying pan over a high heat. Drizzle 4 tbsp of the oil over the
          slices of aubergine and fry them in several batches for 5-7 mins or
          until golden brown and beginning to soften. If they look a little dry
          during cooking, add a dash more olive oil. Set aside on a plate lined
          with kitchen paper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a large flameproof casserole dish or
          saucepan over a medium-high heat. Add the mince and fry for 8-10 mins
          until a deep golden brown, regularly stirring and breaking up with a
          wooden spoon. Tip into a bowl and set aside. Add the remaining oil to
          the casserole. Tip in the onion along with a pinch of salt and fry
          gently for 10-12 mins or until softened and turning translucent. Add
          the garlic, oregano, cinnamon, chilli and bay cooking for a further
          min. Return the lamb to the pan and pour in the red wine, bring to a
          bubble and reduce the wine by half. Stir through the tomatoes, tomato
          purée and brown sugar, along with 200ml water. Season. Lower the heat
          and simmer gently, uncovered, for 20 mins, stirring occasionally until
          the sauce has thickened.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat oven to 200C/180 fan/gas 4. Bring a large pan of lightly salted
          water to the boil. Add the potato slices and cook for 6 mins, drain in
          a colander and leave to steam dry for 10 mins.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt the butter in a small saucepan, stir in the flour and cook over a
          medium heat for 1 min. Remove from the heat and whisk in the milk,
          pouring in a bit at a time, until smooth. Return to the heat and bring
          to a simmer, cooking for 3 mins. Remove from the heat and whisk
          through the parmesan, a little grated nutmeg and some seasoning, and
          finally the whole egg as well as the yolk.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take a large rectangular ovenproof dish. Spoon a third of the meat
          into the dish and spread out evenly, followed by half the aubergine
          and half the potato, then the rest of the meat and another layer of
          aubergines, followed by potatoes. Finish with the béchamel, smoothing
          the top over with a palette knife. Put in the centre of the oven and
          cook for 50 mins or until deep golden brown. If it browns too much
          during cooking, cover the dish. Set aside for 10 mins to cool before
          serving.
